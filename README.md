## Getting Started

To run this application locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3.  **Serve the files:**
    Since the app uses a Service Worker, you need to serve the files using a local web server. You cannot simply open the `index.html` file directly via the `file:///` protocol.

    *   **Using Python (if installed):**
        ```bash
        # Python 3.x
        python -m http.server
        # Python 2.x
        python -m SimpleHTTPServer
        ```
        Then open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`.

    *   **Using VS Code Live Server:**
        If you use Visual Studio Code, you can install the "Live Server" extension, right-click on `index.html`, and choose "Open with Live Server".

4.  **Access the App:** Open your web browser and navigate to the local address provided by your server (e.g., `http://localhost:8000` or `http://127.0.0.1:5500`).

    *   Check/uncheck the boxes for Voice Guidance and Transition Sounds.
    *   Click "Save Settings". Your preferences will be stored locally.
*   **Guided Practice:**
    *   Click "Start" to begin the timed practice based on your saved settings.
    *   Use "Pause" to temporarily stop and "Start" again to resume.
    *   Use "Reset" to return to the beginning of Round 1, Pose 1.
    *   Follow the visual cues (current/next pose) and audio cues (if enabled).
*   **Video:** Watch the embedded video for a visual demonstration.

## PWA Features

*   Once installed, the app can be launched like a native application.
